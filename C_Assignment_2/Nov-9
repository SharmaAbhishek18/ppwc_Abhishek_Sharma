  Q6.Write a program that determines the day number (1 to 366) in a year for a date that is provided as
input data. As an example, January 1, 1994, is day 1. December 31, 1993, is day 365. December 31,
1996, is day 366, since 1996 is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by four, except that
any year divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400. Your program should accept the
month, day, and year as integers. Include a function leap that returns 1 if called with a leap year, 0
otherwise

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a year is a leap year
int leap(int year) {
    if (year % 400 == 0) return 1;
    if (year % 100 == 0) return 0;
    if (year % 4 == 0) return 1;
    return 0;
}

// Function to calculate the day number in the year
int dayOfYear(int day, int month, int year) {
    int daysInMonths[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
    if (leap(year)) {
        daysInMonths[1] = 29; // February has 29 days in a leap year
    }
    
    int dayNumber = day;
    for (int i = 0; i < month - 1; i++) {
        dayNumber += daysInMonths[i];
    }
    return dayNumber;
}

int main() {
    int day, month, year;

    // Input the date
    printf("Enter the day: ");
    scanf("%d", &day);
    printf("Enter the month: ");
    scanf("%d", &month);
    printf("Enter the year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);

    // Calculate the day number
    int result = dayOfYear(day, month, year);
    printf("The day number for %d/%d/%d is %d\n", day, month, year, result);

    return 0;
}
Q7.Write a program to calculate the grade of a student using switch case. The program should ask
the user about the marks obtained by the student and find the grade according to following rule if
mark ≥ 95 the grade ‘O’, if 81 ≤ mark ≤ 94 then grade ‘A’, if 71 ≤ mark ≤ 80 then grade ‘B’, if
61 ≤ mark ≤ 70 then grade ‘C’, if 51 ≤ mark ≤ 60 then grade ‘D’, if 40 ≤ mark ≤ 50 then grade
‘E’, if mark < 40 then grade ‘F’.
Output::#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int marks;
    char grade;

    // Input the marks
    printf("Enter the marks obtained by the student: ");
    scanf("%d", &marks);

    // Calculate grade using switch-case
    switch (marks / 10) {
        case 10:
        case 9:
            grade = 'O';
            break;
        case 8:
            grade = 'A';
            break;
        case 7:
            grade = 'B';
            break;
        case 6:
            grade = 'C';
            break;
        case 5:
            grade = 'D';
            break;
        case 4:
            grade = 'E';
            break;
        default:
            grade = 'F';
            break;
    }

    // Output the grade
    printf("The grade is: %c\n", grade);

    return 0;
}
