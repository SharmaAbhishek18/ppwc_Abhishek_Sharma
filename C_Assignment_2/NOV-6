1.While the goto statement can be used to control program flow, itâ€™s generally recommended to useselection structures and repetition control structures. 
What are the advantages of these of over simple goto statement.
Ans:
Selection structures (like if-else) and repetition control structures (like for and while loops) offer significant advantages over the goto statement, including:
>>>Readability and Maintenance: Code written with selection and repetition structures is generally more readable and 
maintainable. The flow of the program is clearer and easier to follow, which reduces the likelihood of introducing errors.
>>>Structure and Organization: These control structures enforce a more structured and organized approach to programming.
They help avoid the "spaghetti code" effect, where the program's logic becomes tangled and difficult to understand due to multiple jumps.

2.State the purpose of the break statement within a switch case. Can a switch case work without it ?Explain your choice with an example.
Ans:
The break statement in a switch case is used to terminate a case and prevent "fall-through" to subsequent cases.
Without a break, the program continues to execute the next case statements until a break is encountered or the switch statement ends.

Example with Break::
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num = 2;
    switch(num) {
        case 1:
            printf("Case 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Case 2\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Case 3\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Default case\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
Example without Break::
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num = 2;
    switch(num) {
        case 1:
            printf("Case 1\n");
        case 2:
            printf("Case 2\n");
        case 3:
            printf("Case 3\n");
        default:
            printf("Default case\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
